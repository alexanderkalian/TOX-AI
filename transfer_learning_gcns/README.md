This folder contains Python scripts and data files, for a soon to be published study on using transfer learning on GCNs, to predict organ-specific toxicity.

The following folders are included:

| Folder Name | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `datasets` | Pre-processed assay datasets for pretraining (i.e. for later transfer learning), as well as the main training tasks, for the GCN models to use. |
| `pretraining_gcns` | Scripts and output data files for building node features, pretraining all GCNs and finding the best performing GCN trained states. |
